# zeroFormatterJavascript
Javascript parser for ZeroFormatter objects

Origin: https://github.com/neuecc/ZeroFormatter 

The idea in the formatter is that types are declared into templates (classes ex in C# or Java or...)

And these templates should be added into an array in Zero Formatter in case it will be used by another
template
